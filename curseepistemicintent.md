# The Curse of Epistemic Intent

There is a parallel to the [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge) that one could call The Curse of Epistemic Intent.

Epistemic Intent is the strong expectation that acts of communication should be vehicles of epistemically valuable content such as methodologically sound observations of fact or valid (or at least reliable) lines of argument connecting premises to conclusions. These things are valuable both because they can assist you in satisfying your preferences (it is easier to get what you want in the world if you know what the world is really like) and because they often take large amounts of hard work to obtain (but they are non-rival goods and, once obtained, they can be shared at essentially zero marginal cost).

Epistemic Intent is wonderful when it is the shared culture of a group of people, precisely because, within that group, it promotes the exchange of valuable things (i.e. it creates value for everybody).

It becomes a curse, however, when that same strong expectation prevents you from understanding the real logic of a situation.

As an analogy, consider Athletic Intent, the strong expectation that, when engaged in an athletic activity, one should strive to perform to the best standards of the activity in question (run the fastest in a race, handle the ball as proficiently as possible on a basketball court, shoot the truest in an archery competition, ...)

If you meet a person you find attractive (PYFA) in a social context that is also, ostensibly, an athletic situation, it would be a mistake (here defined as a disservice to your own preferences) to give in to Athletic Intent and concentrate with knit brows on your athletic performance while PYFA is laughing out loud with your rival(s) at the lemonade stand nearby.

This is more or less what happens to Epistemically Intent (or Intense, if you prefer) People (EIP) in many organizations (and also what makes most situations involving Sheldon funny in  [The Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)).

EIPs have no trouble understanding that many communication acts (buskers shaking their upturned hats for tips, twins in diapers babbling at each other on YouTube viral videos, early morning commuters exchanging bleary eyed half-greetings as they step on a cold, cold train, ...) are not epistemic in nature.

EIPs are, however, extremely biased against the possibility that some situations that are advertised as epistemic, could, in fact not be epistemic at all (or much, much less so than advertised). Like any other kind of bias, Epistemic Intent clouds sound judgement.

Say a meeting is called on subject S and EIP is invited as a recognized expert in S (good thing that I spent so many months/years learning about S -- thinks EIP to herself -- I'll finally get to share all this bounty!)

As the meeting progresses, and the chairperson gives everybody their five minutes ("Have we considered the possible dangers of S?" says, without adding any details, the person who, for any X, always says "Have we considered the possible dangers of X?"; "I hear that (rival organization) Y is looking into S" says, without adding any details, the person who, for every X, always says "I hear that (rival organization) Y is looking into X"; ... and so on, often in very predictable patterns...) EIP starts feeling vaguely nauseous.

But, but, but... weren't we supposed to talk about S? so what's all this talk about P and Q and T (is there a connection between P/Q/T and S? nobody is explaining what it is...)? And why do we allow this person to say things that are very definitely not true about S, as if she just woke up from a very bad dream about something else?

The EIP goes back to her office and drafts a long message in which she explains the important points that were missed or overlooked in the meeting that just ended (some times she even sends it out); she fantasizes of ordering online ten copies of Harry Frankfurt's [On Bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit) book to leave in the mailboxes of those misguided colleagues who insisted on talking about those irrelevant Ps and Qs and Ts.

In so doing, the EIP often fails to draw the only reasonable conclusion: if the discussion about S did not follow epistemic norms (people who know about S failed to speak up and people who don't know about S failed to shut up), the discussion was *not* epistemically driven. The epistemic output of the discussion (what was learned about S) was not important, what was important was something else. For example, who was invited or who deferred to whom. Or that the final decision was to create a process to deal with S, chaired by a person who just happened to need a chairperson assignment (and the Ps and Qs and Ts that had appeared to EIP as completely irrelevant to the subject S at hand are just the IOUs that the newly appointed chairperson has implicitly agreed to write out to those who supported her bid).

The EIP is like the music lover in the train compartment who fanatically insists on demonstrating the correct fingering for the [Kreutzer Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uPGz7NU-mk) on a Stradivarius that she is unwittingly helping smuggle across the border. The real smuggler, in the meantime, sits in a corner of the compartment, smiles and encourages the EIP, all the while finding it really convenient that the Stradivarius is in the EIP's hands while the border is being crossed.

If you recognize yourself in this form of epistemic fanaticism, ask yourself how often it has been taken advantage of and how many Stradivarii you might have helped smuggle over the years and over which borders.

People often profess amazement at the fact that very successful politicians do not have the self control to steer clear of sexual indiscretions without considering that the drive it takes to be a successful politician is often the very same thing that simultaneously multiplies the presence of temptations around them and the difficulty of resisting them.

By the same token, the dedication and passion and very, very long and hard work it takes to become an expert in a given subject is exactly what makes it very, very hard to realize when that subject is not being taken as seriously as it should by others around you, and that it is rather being used as a pretext to run all kinds of contraband under its cover.

So, at your next job interview, when they ask you what are your weaknesses, instead of going for the fake-weakness bullshit answer "I am a bit of a perfectionist" or "sometimes I feel I care too much" you can just answer: "I am an Epistemically Inten{t|se} Person".

And yes, that is a *real* weakness.
