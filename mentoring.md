# Thoughts on mentoring

## The Alumni

A few years ago I [signed up to volunteer as a mentor for graduates of the college](http://www.sns.it/scuola/associazioni/normalisti/mentoring/) I had attended in the 1980s.

So, every so often (maybe once a year) some of them get in touch with me.

The college has a well deserved reputation for admitting only the very best who then go on to four years of grueling work under the threat of expulsion if their grade average falls below a certain, very demanding, threshold.

This is to say that, by the time they call me (or other mentors), they are certifiably very serious, hardworking and accomplished individuals.

And yet, over the years, I have noticed a pattern in these requests for mentoring: they are not requests for mentoring at all (at least they are not requests for what *I* thought mentoring would or should be).

You see, I am in the very enviable situation of being in a job that is very well paid and as stable as can be (as stable as tenure, let's say). It is also a job that comes at the end of a very long, complex and competitive selection and recruitment process.

This is something very obvious to those recent graduates who, like many other recent graduates in Europe, face a very, very unwelcoming labor market.

So they see me (from their perspective) at the top of the scoreboard in this very complex game and they are looking for the cheat codes.

Well, not exactly: once again, these are hardworking and very principled people and their intent is certainly not to succeed by circumventing the rules. But they quite correctly realize that the game is very, very complex and that it could be very useful to have the rules explained and interpreted by someone who has made it to the finish line.
