# Tillich on the TGV

When I was in junior high, one of the most common activities we'd have in shop class was working on very simple carpentry projects. Perennial favorites were pencil holders, small book shelves, cigar/jewel boxes (depending on which parent you were more attached to), ...

After getting your design approved on paper by the teacher, you would go to the back of the class, reach for a sheet of plywood and carve out of it the pieces you needed for your design which you would then assemble, polish, etc...

Given that our plywood supply was limited, it was considered extremely poor form (and a classic rookie mistake) to be wasteful, i.e. to carve out your pieces so as to leave behind scraps of plywood that would be too small for anyone else to be able to use for *their* designs. Even as a young boy, I was quite smitten by how the commendable principle of "waste not, want not" was articulated geometrically (inside every little boy there is a combinatorial optimizer waiting to be awaken -- usually not by his math teacher) and to this day I am a sucker for [zero waste furniture flatpack design](https://www.google.com/search?q=zero+waste+flat+pack+design&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CBwQsARqFQoTCKmp1onmy8gCFYhIFAodE6cEpw&biw=1239&bih=693).

The plywood of my middle age is uninterrupted thinking time.

The drill saw that cuts into this plywood is spoken language (or, more precisely, speech in a language I understand -- I don't mind if you and your friends are chatting in Nepali right next to me).

I am writing this comfortably ensconced on a seat on the TGV, the high speed train from Luxembourg to Paris (yeah, I know...) where spoken announcements in two of the languages I understand are employed much too frequently for my taste.

Now, this is grossly unfair to the management of the TGV: if you need to get off in Metz, it is important for you to know that you can only alight from certain train cars and not others; if you feel groggy (it is seven in the morning), you'd like to know in which car of the train you will be able to find coffee. I get all of that. It's just that it's not me: I go to Paris, not Metz, and I don't want coffee (and I am also pretty sure that this non-coffee preference is quite stable, i.e. that I won't change my mind during the two hours it takes for the train to reach Paris).

[Paul Tillich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich) once wrote that the fundamental pedagogical mistake is to throw answers like rocks on the heads of those who haven't yet asked the question. I view the TGV announcements in the same light.

If you need to get off the train in Metz, the best possible time for you to be told which car to alight from is *exactly* the moment at which you need to alight (imagine a gently pulsating LED strip that leads you to the right car door as you get up from your seat), not five, or ten or fifteen minutes earlier. If you *don't* need to get off in Metz, the best time to be told is *never*. Similarly, the best possible time for you to be told where coffee can be found on the train is when you want coffee, not before (I imagine this is why, say, museums have signs that point you to the cafe if and when you need it, rather than giving you a five minute lecture on where is what as you enter).

Think of working memory as a problem of inventory. When I push a message on your working memory stack before you strictly need it, I dip into *your* scarce mental resources and force *you* to keep it in *your* mental inventory (on this see the [Zeigarnik Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluma_Zeigarnik#The_Zeigarnik_effect) ). The overall cost of my action is likely a function of

how long the item remains on someone else's inventory,
how many people have to keep it in their inventory and
how costly it is for a given person to do so.

When the recipient of the message simply doesn't have the resources to keep your message in her mental inventory, you might as well not have communicated at all, as any parent with small children quickly learns.

You can think of this as the diachronic version of Zipf's synchronic principle of communication effort. Message senders want to minimize their effort (over time): since they don't want (to expend any effort in order) to figure out *when* the message is going to be maximally useful to you, they send it to you when it is maximally convenient for *them*, which, to be on the safe side, often means much, much longer before it becomes useful to *you*. Message receivers, on the other hand, don't want to allocate any memory resources to keeping the message in their working space and thus would like to receive them as close as possible to the moment when *they* need it.   

Much can be learned about the relative negotiating power of the sender/receiver respectively based on the timing and targeting of these messages. In situations in which the sender has all the power (e.g. a monopoly or a strongly hierarchical situation), messages will be maximally separated from the time when receivers can actually make use them and will be sent exactly *once* and with *no* effort to discriminate between those to whom they apply and those to whom they don't. In situations in which the receiver has all the power (think of a person you are trying to impress or whose repeat business you are competing for in a highly competitive environment) the reverse will happen: you will receive *only* the messages you actually want to receive and *only* when they are immediately useful to you.

A good example of this is how car navigators (which are subject to very strong competitive pressure) have learned to deliver turn-by-turn voice instructions [in a way that maximizes their usability](https://books.google.lu/books?id=7eOcBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=%22timely+instructions+and+natural+voice+cadence%22&source=bl&ots=3RIK_fudJp&sig=99MrKqbMTA_AyTTXo7Se7G2T1QM&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22timely%20instructions%20and%20natural%20voice%20cadence%22&f=false): it would be strictly *unacceptable* for you to be told that you have to make a left turn in 40km from now (and thank god for that).

From this is seems to follow that a good communication design (a Pareto optimal communication design, the one that uses the minimum amount of collective resources and thus creates the greatest collective value) is one that minimizes the total cost of the communication, i.e. one in which such costs are borne by the party that can best afford to bear them. For example, in a kindergarten it is quite appropriate for the *teachers* to have to remember which child needs to take which medicine at which time (as a thought experiment, imagine a kindergarten in which a stern teacher standing in front of a class of toddlers at the beginning of the school year announces, to no one in particular, that children are expected to take their medicine at the required time). That's because a teacher has *more* mental resources than *all* of the class toddlers put together.

This has interesting and somehow surprising consequences with respect to the practice of *personalization*. A commuinicatio system that knows a lot about the likelihood that you and I and aunt Alice will interact with it in specific ways, will be better able to deliver maximally timely and useful messages to you, me and aunt Alice respectively (with the exclusion of the other two, to whom the messages don't apply). An intelligent TGV who expects me, but not you or aunt Alice, to get off in Metz, will tell *me* what car I should alight from, but leave you and aunt Alice undisturbed.  

Remarkably, this seems true even if the system *infers* my preferences from the *revealed/observed/recorded* preferences of other people that are relevantly similar to me. So, just as in [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) respectful communication systems seem to afford [positive externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive): by allowing some of my interactions to be observed and analyzed, I can marginally nudge an existing communication system into becoming one that bothers you (stakes a smaller claim on your cognitive resources) less than it otherwise would have (and possibly/hopefully optimally so).
